Speaker 2  5:45  
All right, let's go out of here. Let's go back to Safari, and let's go to the merchant on Safari.

Speaker 3  5:55  
Go up top left, and then, yes, you

Speaker 2  6:07  
go where it says, home. We're going to make sure it's there, but I believe it's there already, like yesterday, yeah, it's there. Now I have here a question, because I thought about this. You need the money ASAP, as soon as possible, right? Yes, now tomorrow, right? We'll have to do the same thing. But I think that we can do it today. If we use the credit card, FTD or JBC, whatever we can use one of the one of the two cards you have to complete the 3000 that we're missing today. That way we sell everything today, right? And start accounting from today, the process and the retro and the closure of all your pan accounts. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  6:47  
okay.

Speaker 2  6:50  
Now question, have you used the TD card? Do you have any limits on the card? Any specific limits or not?

Speaker 1  6:59  
Yeah, actually, minimum, I need to maintain $4,000

Unknown Speaker  7:04  
otherwise, I would be

Speaker 1  7:08  
getting a charge of monthly fees of some $20

Speaker 2  7:13  
anyways, remember any monthly charge, any fees, anything that's applied, any interest rate that they give it to you. You're gonna get back your money. Nandak, so this can be paid very easily, okay,

Unknown Speaker  7:27  
try to type 2000 not more, just 2000

Speaker 2  7:35  
click on Continue, and instead of the interact, we're going to choose the credit card, debit card option. See if it works.

Speaker 2  7:51  
Sorry again. Second one, the second one where it says credit debit card recommended. It's the second option where it says MasterCard and Visa. Just have to click it. No, no, don't press it. Just click it, perfect, like that, yep, go, continue.

Unknown Speaker  8:11  
But okay,

Speaker 2  8:16  
you have never done this with card. We're gonna I'm gonna teach you if you want, no problem we can pay now.

Speaker 2  8:34  
Perfect. Here, choose the state, obviously, is another state is the province, okay, so choose the province in Canada that you aren't very Tirana, right question once, there you go,

Speaker 1  8:52  
Hi, yeah, actually, my card is not with me. I need to take it. I

Unknown Speaker  9:16  
All right, take your time, in case you need me. Here I am. You.

Speaker 2  10:06  
All right, if the information is correct, you just have to click on

Speaker 1  10:12  
I locked my card because I don't want to use it. I want to control my expenses. That's why I locked the code. I think

Unknown Speaker  10:27  
which one is it from these two?

Unknown Speaker  10:36  
Thank you.

Speaker 1  10:47  
So actually, I am jobless, so I want to control my expresses, so I locked the card. So I just unlocked it.

Speaker 2  10:55  
It makes sense, makes sense. Let's see. Hopefully it's unlocked properly. Click braces deposit and let it load.

Speaker 2  11:16  
All right, just let it load. Your bank will eventually appear here on the screen. You just

Speaker 2  11:33  
letting you know your card is still frozen. Maybe, since you just don't froze it, it takes time to do that. You can use the other card or the one from TD if you want, whatever you prefer,

Speaker 1  11:48  
no TD card. TD, I don't have credit card that was closed already. TD card was closed, but it's displaying for me for some reasons, actually.

Speaker 2  12:05  
So they still show you the credit card in your accounts, but you do not have access or power over the card.

Speaker 1  12:11  
Yeah, it was closed already.

Unknown Speaker  12:16  
That's a bit weird that it's closed.

Speaker 1  12:21  
Have you tried to use it, or you haven't? First of all, I don't have the card at all. They already mentioned as closed, but for some reasons, it's, it's displaying here. Sure. Let's

Speaker 2  12:37  
do something. Click, wait. Says, cash fence right there above. Manage you see from where it says from, and choose the visa it does not appear. Yeah, makes sense. They did not show it either. All right. So let's go to CIBC. Let's double check that the kind of CIBC is properly unfrozen. You know what's better to do? Close CIBC. First close it and then go in CIBC again. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:11  
Close, perfect. And now, yes, go to CIBC. You

Speaker 2  13:28  
you click on the account, click on the one that says CIBC, MasterCard, the first one. And here, in summary, you should be able to see if it's frozen or not. It appears to be unlocked, right? Appears to be unlocked. It's all dropped. Maybe you were using the other one?

Unknown Speaker  14:06  
No, actually, I'm using the correct one. Only,

Speaker 2  14:10  
okay, we can try it again if it does not go through. It's super simple when we do, just put in the visa to checking. But for now, let's try it again. Swipe it again. It should work. Take your time.

Speaker 1  14:38  
No, actually, Paul also already tried this. The card was not working. That's what I remember.

Speaker 2  14:50  
Sorry, nandak, can you repeat what you said? I didn't quite hear you.

Speaker 1  14:54  
Actually directly. If I enter the credit card number here, it's not working. We need to provide some other way than then only, it's transferring

Speaker 2  15:13  
what I can do for you here. I

Speaker 2  15:30  
now, when a card is working, property, these two slows and the bank appears on the screen, okay. When the card does not work. What happens is that these loads and loads and loads and loads and changes and changes and changes. So let's be patient, and let's see what happens here. That's the card that you paid, right? Let's do something. Go to CIBC. Let me help you doing something. Yeah, it.

Unknown Speaker  16:03  
You have a debit CIBC, do you? Yes?

Speaker 2  16:08  
Okay, so we're gonna do something, recess, move money, any year. Transfer size. She's the top right one,

Unknown Speaker  16:22  
the visa, but I

Speaker 2  16:26  
don't know which one. Make sure you've asked the right one, the right number. If you want to go back, you can do it. Or if that's the one, just click on it.

Unknown Speaker  16:40

bill, yeah, for now, that's correct,

Unknown Speaker  17:07  
correct verification. Take your time.

Speaker 2  17:11  
This probably sends you something. Oh, you see your card is blocked. It says that it does not allow you try, maybe with a smaller amount. Try with 1000 let's see If it's 1000 million people, I

Unknown Speaker  18:03  
do you need Help? All right, there you go.

Speaker 2  18:37  
This is the only card, right? What about the other card of CIBC. Is it working? The other one?

Speaker 1  18:42  
Yeah, actually it's displaying, but only two cards are see, if you see here, only two accounts are displaying, other accounts are actually closed. And is

Speaker 2  18:58  
this the one you're using? Why don't you give a call to CIBC? Let's first do something. First. Let's do something. Go to Safari. Okay, here on Safari. Go to the bottom right corner on the two blue squares of the dabs.

Unknown Speaker  19:22  
Bottom right. The blue square is out the tabs,

Speaker 2  19:27  
perfect. Go to the fan. The black one perfect. Here. Go to the left. I don't know if this is okay. It's not a refresh. Interesting. Become performance is the first one on the left. Have to go to the left and click on Performance there, exactly right there. Performance. BOAI,

Unknown Speaker  19:50  
yes, exactly right there. Top left, deposit,

Unknown Speaker  19:56  
amount, 3005

Speaker 2  20:00  
On. Now what you're going to do, Nanda, so that we can see if we can speed up the process and maybe get it done today, right? Just give a call to your CIBC and tell them, hey, I'm using my card. I had it frozen. I unfroze it. Maybe it's not working. Can you allow me to check if it is working? I'm gonna use it okay, and you call me back on these very same number, or you can put me on hold, whatever you prefer. Okay. Anyways, I'm going to be checking a few charts.
