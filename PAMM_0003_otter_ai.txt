Unknown Speaker  4:38  
Make sure you have the credit

Unknown Speaker  4:41  
second option. But

Speaker 2  4:44  
in this mobile this three debit card don't work. Interact only working.

Speaker 1  4:50  
You say that your card does not work. You say that only interact works, yeah, and CIBC works nice with index.

Speaker 2  5:00  
Yeah. Ca, BC, well, in the in pu prime, only interact is working for me. I tried some other card options. Any card options not working at all? Okay, I'm gonna trust everything.

Speaker 2  5:29  
Actually, the problem is pu prime, it's not trusting the card is my mobile is not trusting the top. It's always declining in the background that

Speaker 1  5:41  
doesn't have anything to do with your mobile or with the platform, because we have 1000s of clients using the same banks that you use, and it works. It's basically something definitely related to your profile. But it's fine. I need to worry about it.

Speaker 1  6:39  
Yeah, all right, take your time, make sure that you copy and paste and that's it.

Unknown Speaker  7:08  
You get out of that way. You

Unknown Speaker  7:32  
scroll down, do you have a message?

Speaker 1  7:36  
And since it's out of deposit, you don't need a question. That's good.

Speaker 1  7:45  
Okay, there you go. All right, leave it.

Unknown Speaker  8:02  
Here. Let's confirm

Unknown Speaker  8:09  
returns,

Unknown Speaker  8:14  
and when it loads, click on Home on the bottom.

Unknown Speaker  8:21  
These ones are going to take time. You see that's that's why I prefer to do the car

Speaker 1  8:42  
receive. And check because I mean, your TV sends the track.

Unknown Speaker  8:49  
I'm not sure about your

Unknown Speaker  8:52  
Go down. Go down.

Speaker 1  8:59  
He's transferred that one. I

Speaker 3  9:05  
should

Unknown Speaker  9:10  
do anything, right?

Unknown Speaker  9:16  
We have to wait. I have to wait until then you're actually

Speaker 1  9:20  
in your bu brown account, go to the BU brown accounts, go to the BU prime one insurance. Refreshes here. Try to refresh it. Log out knocks I can or whatever. Okay, and we don't have the message anymore, right? What was the message? Oh, you, you had to carry it right. Open another tab. Open the notes, fast, on the bottom right, on the bottom right, exactly. Click on the one that's fully black, for example, one that's fully black. You. No, not that one, the one that's fully black, the one below that one fully black. Here on the top where it says S block, erase that from the search bar on the top. Erase it and paste the message. I can track the transaction based the message, Stay there. Stay there. E, 399,

Unknown Speaker  10:38  
that gives us here,

Speaker 1  10:42  
Hispanic, determined that you always did interact with your Chevy.

Speaker 2  10:49  
Yeah, actually, I never used I opened recently the these things for my son, for my son. Actually, I opened this account, but

Unknown Speaker  11:06  
I never used much before. Basically,

Speaker 2  11:12  
yeah, only for my son, student account I want to create for him. So for that purpose, I created,

Unknown Speaker  11:22  
so I didn't use it.

Speaker 1  11:26  
Well, what I would say the best thing for you to do is to call CIBC, because they're gonna verify if it's you, because this is the first time that you send an interactive transfer from your CIBC. Okay, so it's gonna take time. So instead of us waiting for who knows how much, maybe 12 or 24, hours, right? Without having an answer and having a clue, it's better for you to call right now civc And tell them, Hey, I just made an E tracky transfer from my checkings account, right? I'll allow the transaction to go through. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2  12:02  
And that's it, okay, okay,

Speaker 1  12:06  
all right, I wait for you here. I am not going home until we finish this. Okay, but I can tell you,

Speaker 2  12:13  
Okay, so if it is done, you today itself, you can start the process. Right? That's why I want to. I

Speaker 1  12:21  
want this, this transfer, if it arrives and we put it on the PAM, we can start everything, right? That's why, since it's sent the old CIBC, and tell them, Hey guys, it's the first time I do any transfer with my CIBC, apparently, right? I sent 3000 Canadian dollars. Okay, interact. Allow the transaction to go through. Thank you. It is me doing it. This is not cryptocurrencies. That's it. Okay, if they ask if it's crypto, obviously it is not crypto. All right, okay. You can, you can hang up here and you can go and call them. I wait for you. Okay, we finished this today. Okay,

Speaker 2  13:04  
when, when it would be ready. After closing, the amount, when it would be ready.

Unknown Speaker  13:13  
Can you speak a bit louder please,

Speaker 2  13:15  
when the amount would be ready after closing, when it would be transferred? What details you need

Speaker 1  13:24  
first, yes. First, when the full collateral margin is in, right, when these 3000 that I mentioned are in, I will proceed closing all the PAM accounts. Because you have three accounts with two, four different Pams, right? You have the aipd, you have GB trade, and you have the performance voai, right, we have to close all of the accounts, and it takes three to five business days to get back to your bank, not more than that. That's not something that I can control that's dependent on the banking system. Okay, okay,

Speaker 2  13:56  
so you need a bank by bank details you need, what details you want to transfer. I don't need any details. Okay, okay, any detail. But how will you transfer the money you'll

Speaker 1  14:12  
see, just put it back into your standard account, and from the standard account, you return it back to any card or within tadaki transfer to any of your banks. Basically. The only thing is that, obviously it's a way higher amounts, so maybe you will have to retrive it in multiple transactions. I don't know what's the limit with interact depends.

Speaker 2  14:29  
Okay, okay. Now simple,

Speaker 1  14:34  
just call cidc, tell them I made the first interactive transfer with these accounts, right? 3000 Canadian dollars. Make it go through. Thank you. It's me doing it. I am aware of what I'm doing. Thank you. That's it, okay, and I wait for you here. Nanda,

Unknown Speaker  14:51  
okay, all right, thank you. All right. And.
